# WooCommerce-Product-Coupon
Requires Wordpress and WooCommerce. Adds a tab in the coupon menu for a linked product assignment. As soon as the given coupon code is added to the shopping cart, the product is automatically added to the shopping cart. 

These can be various products; for example, you could offer your customer a free gift, if he enters this coupon code in the input mask.
You have the possibility to set the price of the product to 0.00 in the product settings or to hide the product in the shop catalogue and search results.

Otherwise it could also be pre-release products or free products that should only be ordered by visitors who have this coupon code.
